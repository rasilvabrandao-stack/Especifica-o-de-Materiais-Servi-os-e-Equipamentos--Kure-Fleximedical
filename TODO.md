# TODO: Integrate Algorithms, Big Data, and Neural Networks into AI Analyzer

- [x] Update requirements.txt with new dependencies: tensorflow, pandas, nltk
- [x] Expand dataset.json with more examples and data for training
- [x] Modify ai_analyzer.py to add NLP-based tokenization and fuzzy matching with NLTK
- [x] Modify ai_analyzer.py to support big data handling with pandas (load larger datasets, preprocessing)
- [x] Implement simple TensorFlow/Keras neural network model for category classification in ai_analyzer.py
- [x] Integrate neural network into AISuggester class with fallback to rule-based
- [x] Install new dependencies
- [x] Test the analyzer endpoint to ensure functionality
- [x] Verify suggestions improve with new integrations
